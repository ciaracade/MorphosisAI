# MorphosisAI
- give me a sec to work on this im fucking around with a cool figma prototype for the frontend
- ikr im starting the frontend first 

- sike you thought, doing the backend first

## Cool resources I used for this project :)

- [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/): lets you generate up to 1,000 rows of realistic test data in CSV, JSON, SQL, and Excel formats.
- [ReactFlow](https://reactflow.dev/): A customizable React component for building node-based editors and interactive diagrams
- [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/): A small, fast and scalable bearbones state-management solution using simplified flux principles. Has a comfy API based on hooks, isn't boilerplatey or opinionated.
- [ElkJS](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs): Implements an infrastructure to connect diagram editors or viewers to automatic layout algorithms.

## Stretch goals
- integrate with other pub/sub messaging softwares like [BlazingMQ](https://github.com/bloomberg/blazingmq).
